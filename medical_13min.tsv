6680	8064	You may knock and then at the room.
9448	9769	Come in.
12878	13881	Hi Miss Alexander.
14182	14303	Hi.
14624	18495	Hi my name is Brittany and I'm a medical student working with Dr. Parrot today.
20416	22661	Try to get this all rubbed in.
23162	24325	It's nice to meet you.
24345	25347	Nice to meet you.
25367	33866	So she sent me in just to ask you some questions and do a brief physical exam and then I will step back out and talk to her and then she'll be in behind me.
33946	34687	Is that okay?
34707	35549	Yeah, that's fine.
35950	36251	Great.
36632	38155	So what brings you in today?
38287	41212	I've been having pretty bad neck pain.
41232	41814	Oh, goodness.
41894	45080	Well, I'm glad you came in so we can take a look and make sure there's nothing going on.
45500	46843	So how long has this been going on?
47304	49067	Probably about two days.
49448	50249	Okay.
50269	53335	Did anything happen a couple days ago out of the ordinary?
53796	56561	Well, I was in a small car accident.
56921	57763	Okay.
57743	59606	It must have been scary.
59666	60708	Yeah.
61249	61810	What happened?
61830	68141	I was at a stoplight and the person behind me rear-ended me.
68641	70364	We weren't going very fast though.
70445	73450	I think he was maybe going five or ten miles an hour.
73470	76976	And were you wearing your seatbelt at the time?
77436	78418	Yeah.
78770	84519	And so you said you didn't go to the hospital or anything because you didn't feel any pain initially.
84560	85701	No.
85721	88065	So when exactly did the pain start?
88085	90069	About how many hours after the accident?
90930	95377	I would probably say maybe four to six hours after.
95397	101267	I think maybe I was just in shock at first and so I didn't really feel any pain or anything.
101247	103830	Where is it bothering you specifically?
103870	106133	Can you pinpoint a specific area on your neck?
106254	110359	It's mostly just the back of my neck and on the sides of my neck.
110739	111360	Both sides?
111440	116307	Yes.
116848	122034	Did you hear any pops or have any numbness or tingling that occurred during the accident?
122155	122455	No.
125078	127862	Is there anything that's making the pain worse?
128213	136948	Mostly when I bend my head forward and try to turn it to the left, it kind of... I noticed it was a little uncomfortable.
137609	139151	Anything you've noticed that's helping it?
140133	148187	I took some ibuprofen and I put ice on the back of my neck and that helped a little bit, but it still hurts.
148207	149208	It still hurts.
149930	151993	And how much ibuprofen are you taking?
151973	158420	I took two tablets every six hours or so since then.
161343	167150	I'm just taking some notes so that way when I go talk to Dr. Parrott I can be thorough and let her know everything you're telling me.
168291	173477	So it's worse whenever you're bending forward into the side to the left.
174178	174898	Is that correct?
174999	175279	Yes.
177461	178082	All right.
179918	181860	And can you describe the pain to me?
181880	189728	It just feels like a tight kind of dull pain.
190148	190488	Okay.
192750	194352	So tight and dull.
197375	200058	And is this pain radiating or moving anywhere?
200918	201619	Not really.
201679	204542	It just goes up and down the back of my neck.
205022	206924	So nothing coming down into the arm?
207004	207265	No.
207925	209807	Okay.
210040	216251	On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain, where would you say you're at?
216852	224245	Probably around a six or a seven out of ten, especially when I try and bend forward and turn my head.
225047	226569	And is it a constant pain?
226589	228172	Yes.
229194	233702	But it'll get worse whenever you bend forward and turn to the left.
235454	241724	And would you say since the accident, since that evening, has it been constant or is it getting worse, better?
241784	242926	What would you say?
242946	249016	It feels like it's getting worse, but I don't know if that's because the ibuprofen's not working.
250699	251600	Well, I'm glad you came in.
251620	258812	So, you know, the over-the-counter stuff's not working and we can do an exam and make sure there's nothing we're missing.
259147	266739	You know, if we need to possibly do some osteopathic treatments and we'll get on to that later, okay?
266759	266859	Okay.
270204	275412	And as far as your past medical history, have you ever had a neck injury before?
275432	275492	No.
275733	276013	No?
277175	278938	So you've never had problems with your neck?
278958	279218	No.
279478	280941	Okay, that's good to know.
281782	287010	And any medical conditions that you're currently being treated for or that you've ever been treated for?
286990	293824	I have asthma and I take medicine for that.
293984	294425	Okay.
294445	295147	That's about it.
295868	297171	Ever been hospitalized?
298032	298293	No.
298333	300898	Ever had any surgeries?
301459	304305	I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid.
304325	306670	I think that was probably nine.
309603	315371	And as far as medications, you said you take the over-the-counter ibuprofen and then you take something for asthma.
315391	316493	What do you take for your asthma?
316513	317574	I take albuterol.
319097	322782	Do you just take that as needed?
322802	324424	And do you take any other medications?
324845	332556	I take a loratidine or a claritin for allergies.
336535	339600	What about any herbal supplements, vitamins?
339901	341103	I take a multivitamin.
344809	348275	And I always like to ask all my patients, any recreational drug use?
348656	349297	No, none.
352643	354406	And are you allergic to any medications?
354907	356890	I am, I'm allergic to penicillin.
358642	361005	And what happens when you take penicillin?
361265	362427	I break out in a rash.
362487	363388	In a rash?
364048	367152	Well, we'd be sure never to give you penicillin for anything.
367232	367573	Thank you.
368614	374361	And as far as family history, any medical conditions in the family with your mom and dad?
375262	378085	My mom, she's pretty healthy.
378125	382330	She has diabetes, though, and it's pretty under control.
383231	387957	My dad has high cholesterol, but he takes medicine for that.
389962	391566	Any brothers or sisters?
391806	393390	I have a brother and he's healthy.
393410	393730	He's healthy?
393750	395454	He doesn't have any conditions or anything.
398120	403652	And no one's ever had problems with joints or arthritis?
404033	404354	No.
404534	404775	No.
404955	405156	No.
406499	406599	Okay.
406619	407160	Great.
408558	413304	And I always like to just get an overview of my patients, kind of get to know them a little better.
413624	414625	What do you do for a living?
414906	417068	I'm an administrative assistant.
417089	417869	Oh, where do you work?
418290	420653	I work for the Fish and Wildlife Services.
421174	421734	Oh, wow.
421935	422615	That must be fun.
422796	423136	Yeah.
423176	424177	You've been doing it for a while?
424478	425599	Yeah, for a few years.
426460	427722	Stressful or pretty?
428543	430465	It's not very stressful at all.
430445	431649	That's good.
432091	432873	And are you married?
433134	433455	I am.
434599	435563	Congratulations.
435583	436225	Thanks.
436245	437188	Do you have any children?
437228	438432	No, not yet.
438453	439396	No children?
439436	440640	No.
443489	445511	And so do you have hobbies that you like to do?
445531	446452	I do.
446472	448794	I like to cook and I like to garden.
448855	456082	It's been kind of difficult to garden because I can't lean forward as much for the past two days.
457503	460847	Yeah, it can be frustrating when you can't do the things you enjoy.
460867	462108	Yeah.
462308	463289	Any tobacco use?
463770	468855	I smoke probably maybe half a pack a day if that.
469336	470577	And how long have you been smoking?
471502	475587	Oh, I want to say maybe seven years or so.
477009	477109	OK.
477129	477990	Any alcohol use?
479152	479873	Occasional.
480754	484359	I'll have a glass of wine with dinner maybe once a week.
484379	484439	OK.
487523	488564	All right.
488584	491668	Well, I believe I got all the information I needed from you.
491708	494612	So we're going to go ahead and move on to the physical exam portion.
495153	498758	So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to have you take a seat up here.
498778	500580	OK.
506821	511167	All right, for the physical exam, I'm gonna go ahead and listen to your heart and lungs and make sure those sound nice and clear.
511187	516055	So I'm just gonna slide this down and just breathe normal.
524587	526210	And go and take a big deep breath.
527151	528853	And again.
531758	531998	Again.
534482	535343	And last one.
537415	545288	And so I'm just going to do a structural exam here and palpate down your spine.
545308	547051	Let me know if there's anything that's tender.
547091	549154	It's tender everywhere.
551017	551979	Work my way down.
559190	561094	And I'm going to check the range of motion in your neck.
561114	563878	So what I want you to do is try to put your chin down to your chest.
565782	567624	It's about as far as I can go.
568024	570967	And then looking up to the ceiling, pretty stiff.
574350	574811	Okay.
575151	577614	And what about turning and looking over to this shoulder?
577634	581638	Okay.
581658	583700	Alright, and turn and look to that shoulder for me.
587303	587904	Right there.
588144	589445	And then ear to your shoulder.
589485	592228	Trying to touch your ear over to your shoulder.
593390	594972	and then ear to the other shoulder.
594992	602339	And I'm going to go ahead and check just some reflexes.
602359	605542	This will kind of tell me if there's any nerves that are involved.
605602	606684	So just relax your arm.
609046	611308	And we're going to rest your arm right here on your lap.
614512	615473	And just relax.
617334	618876	And I'm going to do the same thing on this arm.
619857	620798	So just relax your arm.
624288	626832	And just relax.
626852	628715	And then last one, just let your arm hang.
632021	633944	And now I'm going to test and see how strong you are.
633964	635266	So place your arms like this for me.
635407	636609	And don't let me move your arms.
637931	641056	Good.
641076	642318	And arms up.
642338	644622	And don't let me push them.
644642	645063	Good.
645083	646125	And fingers out for me.
646505	647407	Don't let me squeeze them.
648308	650532	And fingers together and try to push them out.
652452	656096	If it's okay with you, as an osteopathic student, we've learned some treatments.
656156	660822	So I'm going to do some soft tissue to try and break up some of this tension that you're having.
661343	662604	If that sounds okay.
663365	664667	I'm going to hurt myself.
665107	666148	No, it's not going to hurt.
666168	668191	And if there's any pain, I want you to let me know.
671615	674138	And so I'm just going to do just very gentle.
674158	675580	It's called myofascial.
676621	679945	I'm just going to slowly up.
689037	697145	And if this is something that you do get some relief from after this evening, then you can come back and we can be a little more aggressive.
697205	701029	But since the car accident was just two days ago, I want to be very gentle.
705954	706054	Okay.
706074	708197	We're just going to hold this right here.
708257	714683	All those muscles that are tight and spasming right now attach right up where my fingers are at.
714723	717306	So I'm just trying to get them to relax and loosen.
723817	728324	So this is supposed to relax all the muscles in my neck.
732671	734774	All right, I think that'll be enough for today.
734814	737999	I don't want to do too much since it was such an acute injury.
738380	740323	So I'm going to go ahead and help you up.
745822	750921	And then I'm gonna go ahead and summarize everything that you told me from earlier, if that's okay.
751583	753430	Would you prefer sitting back down in the chair?
753470	757806	Sure.
758242	763870	Okay, so you started having some neck pain two days ago after a motor vehicle accident.
764631	767395	You were rear-ended, but you were wearing your seat belt.
767956	781635	You didn't hear any pop or have any numbness or tingling that occurred, and it's just been real tight for the past two days, real constant, but it's worse whenever you flex your head down or turn it to the left.
781935	783237	Is that correct?
783217	790085	And as far as your past medical history, you just have asthma and you're taking some medication for that.
790145	791586	Okay.
791907	793368	And you're not allergic to anything.
793408	794410	Penicillin.
794470	795511	Excuse me, yes, that's right.
795531	796992	You are allergic to penicillin.
797593	797853	All right.
798194	806003	What I will do is I will go talk to Dr. Parrott and then we will be back in to put together a treatment option plan for you.
806043	807044	Okay.
807064	809687	Any other questions or concerns you have for me today?
809707	811028	No, I don't think so.
811349	812650	I just want to feel better.
812731	815999	Alright well that is our main goal so I'm glad you came in today.
816039	816705	Great.
816725	817290	Thank you.
817310	817915	Thank you.
