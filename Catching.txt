[SPEAKER_01]: Jane?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been ages since I last saw you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you and Jackie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your new baby, George, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a good memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he's two now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you still working in the health centre?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, for the time being, but we're moving in a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, I'd better go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm late for work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely to see you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, likewise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in touch.
