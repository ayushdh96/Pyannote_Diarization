31	4999	If you're applying to medicine in the UK, you're probably wondering what an online interview is actually like.
5440	16758	Although there are lots of resources and they can tell you what subjects are going to come up, there's nothing out there that's going to show you from your perspective what you're going to experience when you go through your online medicine interview.
17339	25853	Until now, I've managed to get permission to share with you a real interview and from the point of view of the interview, what it's going to feel like,
25833	35905	the kind of thing that's going to happen and what happens when you do an online interview exactly the progression and how it feels, how it happens so that you can prepare and know exactly what's coming.
36025	52785	If you want some help and have an interview like this simulated reach out to us because we're doing an interview crash course to get people ready but for now you can watch this video where you can see exactly what an interview is like enjoy try and learn from it as much as possible and hopefully it can help prepare you for your real interview on the day.
52765	55788	So you're going to see everything as the interviewee sees it.
55808	61935	So the questions as they pop up, the stations as they rotate through them, the different panels as they move through those.
62035	63757	But otherwise, I hope you find this useful.
64158	68423	Let's see if from going through the video you can guess which university this interview belongs to.
68823	79515	But otherwise, enjoy and I will see you at the end.
79799	82304	Nice to meet you.
82384	84669	Looking down at any points because we're just taking notes.
86673	93025	So your first question is, can you tell us about a time when you've disagreed with someone at home, school or work?
93366	95310	So what happened and how has it resolved?
96522	99525	I guess I have a pretty good example for this.
99826	106172	I have a pretty close personal friend, we've been friends for a few years now, I think probably six, seven, eight years.
107033	113320	And he was quite strongly against taking the COVID vaccinations.
113841	119627	And it was just the COVID vaccination specifically, he's not anti-vax, he's had his shots when he was younger.
119607	134308	But when this came up, obviously it had been coming up quite a lot throughout COVID, you know, we're saying you need to get your vaccine, there's people falling out, you might fall ill, we're concerned for you.
134845	138732	literally the last whole two years, he's just been saying, no, I'm not getting vaccinated, I'm not doing it.
138973	151176	And from my understanding now, it's just because he's against Pfizer and these big pharmaceutical companies, he has some kind of pretty suspicious thing against feeding into these mega pharmaceutical companies.
152058	153360	And obviously,
153931	183010	me being the medical friend in the group I've tried to speak to him separately like out away from everyone else like you know this is going to be good for your health I understand that you might have these problems with these companies but at the end of the day it's fair and good and you know it's not like you don't interact with these sort of companies in another scenario for example he uses Instagram and in my opinion that could be just as harmful or more harmful than feeding it to Pfizer honestly and
182990	188559	You know, we did have a big conversation about this and we did go back and forth.
188619	194969	But at the end of the day, I recognized that he was just so stuck in his view.
195169	199176	There wasn't really anything I could say to him that would be able to convince him otherwise.
199416	201760	And unfortunately, he still hasn't got his vaccine.
201860	207529	And as a result, he didn't manage to go on a trip with the rest of the group to Europe.
207509	222099	So he was left out during that, and that was quite unfortunate that I hadn't been able to convince him, but I recognize that if I kept pushing and trying to get him to do this, honestly, like we've been going on for two years, it's not going to change anything.
222199	228572	And I didn't want to keep patronizing him because clearly he wasn't going to change his mind, which is quite unfortunate, honestly.
228890	241958	Thank you and obviously from this example you kind of said that unfortunately it didn't work out but why do you think it's kind of important for doctors to need to be able to be good at working with other people?
243401	247911	Yeah well I think it's important to be able to work with
248178	254267	difficult patients just because at the end of the day, as doctors, we're trying to work in their best interest.
254287	259634	And sometimes they may be difficult simply because they don't understand the situation.
260115	271571	So it's important to make sure that the patients that you're speaking to fully understands what's going on with them, what options they have available, and what's happened so far, so that they fully understand the situation.
271631	276818	And then they might be able to
277186	282360	come to see what you're saying as the doctor, what recommendations you're making, they might be able to understand it a bit better.
283302	293389	And as the doctor, you're just there to be the caregiver, you're not there to change ideologies, you're
293673	296417	you're just there to help improve the health of a patient.
296517	318347	So obviously if they're very strongly against an idea, for example, just because of religious background or some kind of something that's happened in the past, I think it's good to be able to deal with that without bringing, sorry.
318935	334154	without angering the patient, I think it's important to be able to explain your viewpoint correctly and in a way that they can understand so that they can potentially bring down the level because if they understand the situation, if they understand you're there to help them, then their life's going to be difficult.
335516	335716	Thank you.
336216	341303	And my last question is, can a doctor ever have too much empathy and respect for a patient's views?
342925	346309	Too much empathy and respect for a patient's views.
347892	352270	I think definitely too much respect for patients who use I can see that happening.
353756	357531	For example, if if it's something relatively minor.
358102	383097	um like oh I'm scared of needles I don't want to get this injection and then the doctor's like okay you don't want you don't want it okay we won't uh I think that's that's that's a bit too far um in that case it's kind of unreasonable where like if if you haven't asked to see you know why why are you scared of these needles why do you not want to if you just son if you just straight away um
383077	400692	conform to whatever the patient wants without finding out why or finding out what the reasons are, then it can be harmful because at the end of the day, potentially this injection could have been very helpful for, I don't know, finding out some more details about the condition that they have or something else along those lines.
401873	406737	And in terms of too much empathy, that's a difficult question, honestly.
406797	412122	I think it can become a problem at some point.
413384	417748	Obviously, if you're... Hi, sorry, I'm gonna have to cut.
417768	417968	Sorry.
418829	419289	Okay, that's fine.
420430	420550	Sorry.
420570	426135	For the next question, it's a hypothetical scenario, so I'm going to read out to you first.
427417	427517	Okay.
427537	429478	One of the junior doctors on the hospital ward.
430119	441349	The day after his surgery, a 70-year-old man is transferred to intensive care with a life-threatening pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the chest.
441751	453028	During a routine meeting, the consultant reviewing the complication identifies that one of the junior doctors has failed to prescribe the medication required to prevent this type of blood clot.
453048	461061	So the question is, firstly, how will you respond personally knowing that your lack of action has had serious implications for a real person?
463584	463945	Well,
465005	471194	I think I believe it's called duty of candle where it's expected of a doctor to be all about their mistakes.
471694	480267	So I think especially for us in the situation personally, I would I would make sure to say to the consultant and when appropriate to the patient, look, I've made this mistake.
480347	482410	I failed to prescribe this medicine.
482550	483511	This is this is on me.
484853	487116	So I think I would go to the consultant and explain that.
487276	491923	And I think it's important to turn up in that situation because it's it's quite serious.
493169	496699	Well, even if it wasn't serious, I think it's important to note just for the sake of clarity.
499747	509052	You partly answered this, but just in case you had anything else to add to it, why do you think it's important for doctors to lay this duty of Canada, so ending up to their mistakes?
509943	514529	Yeah, I think it's important and I think two main ways.
514709	529268	So one being transparency to the patient and the public, it ensures or helps ensure that the patients trust the doctors because if they've made a mistake and they're trying to cover up or they're not making it obvious or they're just not telling you as the patient.
529248	548001	then they're going to lose trust because obviously you've gone and made a mistake and then you're not telling them they're just next time they might not even come to the doctors because they've had bad experiences in the past now they won't trust the doctors because they think oh they're just going to lie to me or they're just not going to help me because they have made a mistake last time.
549062	553450	And it's also important in terms of I think
554020	555584	your own self-improvement as well.
555986	566275	You need to be honest with that mistake and being able to be honest with that will help you improve in the future because then people can help correct you with that.
567436	588907	And I guess as well, it would be important for the sake of the patient and that specific scenario and the care that you're going to do to the patient because if you've made a mistake, for example, I guess it's not exactly the scenario, but if you've given the wrong prescription rather than not a prescription at all, then it might have different side effects and different interactions with some sort of other care that you might have to provide to the patient.
590249	596177	So yeah, I think there are definitely multiple reasons that you should have to be as clear as you can with any mistakes they make.
597440	598522	Okay, thank you.
599063	608161	Your next question is, how would you inform your fellow staff members, say, following on about this scenario that I read at the start?
608221	617459	Okay, so I think, as I said, I'd probably go first to the consultant just because he's the one that highlighted the problem in the first place.
618601	620224	And
621622	640190	Yeah, after I've spoken to him, unless he's already made this disclosure that I've made the mistake, I think, maybe I'm not sure if this would be the most appropriate place, as obviously I haven't been in the scenario myself, but potentially at the next MDT meeting, because then everyone that's concerned with that patient's care is going to be present.
640831	643154	And then you can, you can be completely honest with everyone.
643174	644176	Look, I've made this mistake.
644196	647781	This is what's happened as a result of my mistake.
648790	662692	And then everyone who's concerned will be enlightened as to the situation and then we can move forward there with dealing with the problem and everyone can work together as the MDT to be able to provide the best care considering the situation that's happened.
664735	665577	Okay, thank you.
666318	669803	And have you ever made any mistakes that have impacted other people?
669844	672047	And how did you overcome this?
673124	679150	Yeah, so I made a mistake back in, it was during my A level.
679210	688840	So I, as I would often read ahead in class, I would be quite well informed as to the subjects that we're covering and especially during tests that would help me out quite a lot.
689441	698631	And as a result, my friends that I had in the subjects, they would come to me for help with revision or if they found something particularly difficult, they'd say, hey, can you explain this to me?
698671	700853	Can you help me with this question?
701660	706947	What ended up happening, I think this was, I believe it was to do with muscles.
707689	721508	There's like two marks at the very end of this paper, and the teacher told us beforehand because we hadn't covered in class at the time but they still gave us the question for whatever reason, and the teacher was like, okay, go look and learn it yourself.
721488	726398	And obviously my friends came to me said look this is, you've already covered this can you help us with this instead of course yeah.
726819	730988	So I sat down and then I told them through I spoke like I explained the process.
731690	737522	And when it came to doing the exam I thought it was pretty right I got marks at the end of the day but then.
737924	740788	They came and spoke to me afterwards and said, you told us the wrong thing.
740908	742430	All of us got zero marks on that question.
743091	747937	And obviously at that point, I felt really bad because I've gone and told the wrong thing.
747997	754326	So I made sure to get all of them together again and see what the answers they put.
754827	757370	And then I also asked the teacher, can you come and help us with this?
757390	759773	Just because I tried to explain this and I did it wrong.
759793	761215	So I want to make sure that I'm right this time.
761515	762756	Can you come and help us with this?
763457	765199	As well as that.
765259	768702	So yeah, I got all of their answers together and made sure to see what they said.
769803	773667	I also asked the teacher for the mark scheme so I could see what the mark scheme wanted me to say.
773687	781255	And I also had the textbook and spec up at the time just so we could make sure that 100% that we've got this right for the next time.
781395	781955	Thank you.
782136	782576	Thank you.
783197	783517	Thank you.
788062	788822	I'm Mahini.
788842	789463	I'm with the assessors.
791924	795837	So the first question is, what are your qualities that would make me want you as my doctor?
795857	799810	Can I have just a second to think about it?
800312	800753	Of course.
826855	828076	I think I'm ready to come out.
828096	830619	Okay.
830639	834764	So first and foremost, I think I'm quite an empathetic person.
835144	840250	I believe that I will be able to facilitate your needs as best as I can.
840310	851462	I'll try to understand the situation that you're in and taken into account all of the everything about you so that I can provide the best care to you and
852100	856344	in light of all the resources and everything that we have access to in that scenario.
858686	862109	Furthermore, I'm quite an academic person and I enjoy learning.
862470	868295	I will use that to make sure that I do the best of my abilities during my time at medical school to become the best doctor that I can.
868355	875141	And throughout my career as a doctor, I will continue to develop my skills so that I'm up to date on the best information that we have available at the time.
875181	881247	And I will use this to make educated decisions and recommendations about your care.
882070	883492	Okay.
885254	902937	And yeah, I think, I think overall, I'll put you at the center of everything and make sure to keep you informed about all decisions that we make about your care and make sure that you're involved throughout the entire process so that you're informed, sorry, so that you're able to make the best decisions that you believe are appropriate for you.
902957	903178	Okay, yeah.
903198	908685	So you've mentioned some good qualities there, like, can you describe how you demonstrate these qualities?
909779	920716	Yeah, so one scenario in which I think I've demonstrated empathy is during some working experience I completed during last summer.
921638	929350	I was at a care home for OB-Ecosso, and during this time I was speaking with the residents there building relationships with them.
930272	934318	And one resident in particular stood out to me.
934298	947776	this elderly lady she happened to be from Bangladesh and as a result she only spoke Bengali she didn't speak very much English I think all the English I heard her speak during my time there was asking for a spoon.
949719	964018	Luckily I am also from Bangladesh and I can also speak Bengali so I did spend quite a lot of time speaking with her finding out about her situation and you know just spending some time with her because as she told me she was
964420	965742	becoming incredibly isolated.
965802	973834	None of the carers that could speak Bengali, none of the residents that could speak Bengali, and her daughters, I think she had two daughters both in uni age.
975035	984209	They rarely came to visit and she'd been there for years and I just can't imagine how awful it would have been to be sat there for years and barely having anyone to speak to throughout the day.
984269	987053	So I made sure that during my time there I would
987033	991719	I would make sure to see that she's okay and be able to provide any help that I can.
991819	996525	I'll ask if she's feeling okay, if she wants some food or she wants some help from a specific carer.
997807	999329	That sounds like a good display of empathy.
1000090	1007539	What qualities do you have that you think could could impair your own performance as a doctor and how would you deal with those?
1009021	1030371	I think something that is kind of something that might affect me in the future is I haven't really had to deal with any kind of significant I guess in this in the specific scenario of me being a doctor I've had to deal with a patient's death that's been my responsibility.
1030351	1037684	Obviously me just being a gap year student at the moment, but it's something that I look forward.
1038405	1042171	I see forward to that being a potential scenario in the future.
1042191	1047921	And it is something that's potentially kind of scary, as obviously I haven't had to deal with something like that before but
1047901	1066847	I believe that I tend to be able to make the best use of the resources I have access to and I recognise that there are support groups that I can speak to if I have any problems with these and obviously I can speak to my colleagues, friends and family if I'm having any particular struggles to deal with these sort of things that I'll be able to talk it out and I'll be able to deal with it better.
1069090	1074077	Is that the thing you think you find the hardest about being a doctor or is there anything else you think you find hard about being a doctor?
1074833	1079260	Um, I'm not sure if it's what I would say I'd find the hardest.
1079320	1081464	Obviously, I don't know what it's like to be a doctor.
1081644	1082586	I'm not a doctor yet.
1083387	1087874	So, but I do recognize there are multiple things that can be difficult about the job.
1089417	1095066	Something that I've had a bit of experience with during some other work experience at the hospital, Luke hospital.
1095767	1100014	I spent quite a lot of time at A&E shadowing some doctors there and
1100483	1104970	The pressure of the situation was very obvious and very upfront.
1105050	1107934	It was quite clear that everyone was under pressure.
1107974	1109076	Everyone's very stressed out.
1109156	1110257	There's so many things going on.
1111039	1116066	So that is something that I did notice quite a lot during my time there.
1116186	1129005	However, I feel I've generally dealt with stress quite well in my previous years, such as during my A-Levels and GCSEs through physical activity or my own hobbies.
1128985	1130369	The next question.
1130409	1132855	Thank you for the next question.
1133717	1140755	And it is, can a doctor or medical student be opposed to COVID vaccination?
1145427	1145728	I.
1146974	1154682	I believe if you would like to go into work at the moment in the UK, you are required to have your COVID vaccinations.
1155923	1171540	And this is just because for the sake of the patient, obviously, if you're a doctor or a medical student, you're constantly being exposed to so many different patients in a hospital where it's likely that you're going to be exposed to someone potentially with COVID.
1172241	1176205	It's important to be vaccinated so that if you do
1176185	1185537	happen to become exposed to and catch COVID, you're going to be less symptomatic and therefore less likely to be able to pass it on to someone else later down the line.
1185898	1190464	And that's important because obviously there are going to be different patients who are vaccinated and who aren't.
1191125	1201078	And most importantly, it's going to be for those patients who aren't vaccinated for whatever reason they happen to have because if you as a doctor are going around passing COVID to patients, obviously that's
1201058	1207071	I guess it would be going against your non-merficence of autonomy because you are pretty much directly just causing harm.
1208033	1218055	I believe that I've, I mean, I have a close personal friend who's quite, who hasn't taken their COVID vaccines, they're just quite against that general idea.
1218372	1219173	They're not anti-vax.
1219213	1222618	They've had vaccinations in the past, but they're specifically against COVID vaccines.
1223659	1231811	They have some kind of predisposed disliking for Pfizer and those big pharmaceutical companies.
1231951	1234274	So they've chosen not to get COVID vaccines.
1234354	1236457	And I've had a bit of experience dealing with that.
1236537	1240583	However, I think in this scenario, if you're a medical student or a doctor, it's
1241390	1250383	pretty much it's unexcusable not to have your vaccines as you're always dealing with these patients and you need to be, I think, trying to practice what you preach.
1250683	1260056	If you're trying to practice good health, you should be getting the most updated vaccines and obviously you're going to be recommending that patients get vaccines for their own health.
1261038	1264663	Okay, so you've mentioned some really good points about COVID vaccines then.
1264981	1267967	and why doctors should have them.
1268007	1275942	So another question is why is it compulsory for doctors to be vaccinated against hepatitis B?
1279168	1283817	So hepatitis B in particular isn't something I'm too familiar with.
1284623	1289573	especially considering it's not on any kind of BCCR level spec that I've experienced in the past.
1291056	1298671	From my limited understanding, I believe it can be passed on through blood contact or some kind of bodily fluid contact.
1299413	1304623	And if it can be transmitted through that kind of process,
1304603	1312240	being a doctor it would mean that because you know you might have to take blood samples or from multiple different patients during a day or throughout your life or your career.
1312741	1319676	It would one mean that you're incredibly more likely to be exposed to that kind of thing compared to the average person just because
1319656	1324582	you're seeing so many different people and you're having to take these blood samples.
1325042	1334954	And two, it's going to also make it more likely that you're going to pass it on to someone just because when you're taking these samples, then there's a higher chance of having contact that can result in transmission.
1336596	1337437	Thank you very much.
1337818	1344145	Another question I have for you is, how freely can a doctor express their personal views?
1347209	1349612	I believe that it should be
1350436	1353761	they should judge the situation and do it appropriately.
1353801	1357526	I think that sometimes it can be appropriate.
1357586	1364076	For example, if a patient says to them, you know, I'm unsure what decision to make a dog, what do you think I should do?
1364676	1366399	I think in that case, it's very appropriate.
1366479	1371746	You know, they're clearly asking for your opinion and they want some expert opinion in this situation.
1372027	1377034	And I think in that case, then it would be kind of rude not to give your opinion.
1377655	1379617	However, there are definitely situations where you shouldn't.
1381499	1399219	For example, I don't know if there's a patient who's transgender, for example, I think it would be quite inappropriate for a doctor to just kind of out of nowhere mention, oh, I'm part of the support group that helps deal with people coming to terms with their birth gender.
1399239	1402903	I think in that case, it would be very inappropriate and potentially even harmful.
1402883	1415690	to the patient and especially the patient-doctor relationship because the patient will become offended and probably become offended in that scenario and it would probably lead to a breakdown of trust and just cause further harm to that patient.
1419599	1423407	So does a doctor have a duty to be a role model?
1424990	1429919	Yeah, I would say that doctors have a duty to be a role model.
1430039	1439978	I think being in a position to be able to give care, I think it's quite a privileged position and it's important that one of the
1443265	1443846	So there we have it.
1444287	1446871	Did you guess which university that interview belonged to?
1446911	1449775	If so, pop it in the comments and I'll tell you if you're right.
1449956	1451939	I hope you can see exactly what that's like now.
1451999	1454483	So you can see it kind of is a bit awkward at the start.
1454523	1457007	There's some brief introductions, but they just dive straight in.
1457227	1459030	They'll cut you off halfway through.
1459229	1466280	when you're ending with that particular breakout room and you move on to the next set of people, it just abruptly ends and they move you on.
1466701	1469184	So just be prepared for exactly that sort of thing.
